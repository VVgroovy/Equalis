# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Equalis!

## Getting started
- Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
- Node 20+, `npm install`, then `npx hardhat compile`.
- Run a local node `npx hardhat node` if you need to deploy locally.

## Code style
- Follow existing formatting and the guidelines in docs.
- Keep functions small, use meaningful names, handle errors early.
- Add tests where applicable.

## Commits & PRs
- Use clear commit messages (conventional style preferred).
- Reference issues. Small PRs are easier to review.
- Add context in the PR description and testing notes.

## Security
- Never commit secrets. Report vulnerabilities privately to maintainers.

## Docs
- Update `README.md` and `docs/` when changing behavior or public APIs.

## Governance
- Sensitive parameter changes go through on-chain governance (timelock).

Thank you for contributing!
